I have taken my time to make this my best every program to date, develop\r\nand evolve from the last FBB V1 and give you a complete progress training program to\r\nhelp you build a better body and more solid foundation to go on.\r\nThank you giving 100% - Look out for V 3.0 later in the year!\r\nChris"
